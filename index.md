 Remote-Access-To-Car Demonstration<br>
 We integrated our navigation app with telematics-system-partner and that allowed our customers to have access to car features (ignition, locks, etc.) via our app.
 I was responsible for design, scope and development of server components and managed team of 4 developers, who also worked there.<br><br>

**Senior SDE** @ [Yandex.Translator](https://translate.yandex.com/) _(May 2018 - Jun 2019)_ <br>
Training translation models and development of data pipelines
<details align="justify">
 <summary>Details</summary>
 <ul>
  <li>Designed and developed end-to-end data aggregation pipeline: from application on device to table in the MR-storage</li>
  <li>Improved translation quality on Turkish language family via training new types of neural models. **Waiting for patent**</li>
  <li>Implemented Alternatives-For-Translation backend based on neural language model API</li>
  <li>Tools: C++14, Python, NLTK, TF, Yandex MapReduce, Transformer RNNs, HG</li>
 </ul>
 <i>
 Alternatives-For-Translation Demonstration<br>
 I worked on optimal extraction of probabilities from translation model to allow us suggest alternative words. Also, I had to alter model's predictor API.<br><br>
 As a result, we have server API for this kind of task, and here you can see example of this tool's usage on en-ru language pair:
