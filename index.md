<ul>
 <li>Designed and developed end-to-end data aggregation pipeline: from application on device to table in the MR-storage</li>
 <li>Improved translation quality on Turkish language family via training new types of neural models. **Waiting for patent**</li>
 <li>Implemented Alternatives-For-Translation backend based on neural language model API</li>
</ul>
<i>
Alternatives-For-Translation Demonstration<br>
I worked on optimal extraction of probabilities from translation model to allow us suggest alternative words. Also, I had to alter model's predictor API.<br><br>
As a result, we have server API for this kind of task, and here you can see example of this tool's usage on en-ru language pair:
