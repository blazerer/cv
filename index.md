* Train models in highly ambiguous area
* Develop data pipelines and implemented business logic 
* Conduct investigations of anomalies 
* **Tools**: Hack, Python, FB ML libraries, Hive/Spark, MySQL, HG, plenty of FB-tools

**Technical lead** @ [Yandex.Auto](https://auto.yandex/promo) _(Jun 2019 - Nov 2020)_ <br>
* Designed and scoped service‚Äôs dashboards and metrics calculation processes
* Designed and scoped proprietary push-service for our devices based on WebSocket

* Designed and developed server-side applications for integrations with partners (eg. Remote-Access-To-Car)
* Participated in interviewing, onboarding, mentorship, project management
* **Tools**: C++14, PlantUML, Yandex server tools, Yandex Arc
<details><summary>Remote-Access-To-Car project Demonstration</summary>
<br>
 We integrated our navigation app with telematics-system-partner and that allowed our customers to have access to car features (ignition, locks, etc.) via our app.
 I was responsible for design, scope and development of server components and managed team of 4 developers, who worked there.

**Senior software development engineer** @ [Yandex.Translator](https://translate.yandex.com/) _(May 2018 - Jun 2019)_ <br>
* Designed and developed end-to-end data aggregation pipeline from application on device to table in the MR-storage
* Improved translation quality on Turkish language family via training new types of neural models **(waiting for patent)**
* Implemented Alternatives-For-Translation backend based on neural language model API
* **Tools**: C++14, Python, NLTK, TF, Yandex MapReduce, Natural language processing, Transformer RNNs, HG
<details><summary> Alternatives-For-Translation Demonstration</summary>
<p>
<br>
I worked on optimal extraction of probabilities from translation model to allow us suggest alternative words. Also, I had to alter model's predictor API.
As a result, we have server API for this kind of task, and here you can see example of this tool's usage on en-ru language pair.

<details><summary>Logs API Demonstration</summary>
<p>
 <br>
I designed and developed server side of this API to allow customers extract logs of their applications from our storage.
 Here you can see how process of the data download looks like.

**Software development engineer** @ [ModuleWorks](https://www.moduleworks.com/) 3ax Team _(Mar 2012 - Feb 2015)_ <br>
* Solving sculpture surface machining and computational geometry problems
* Implemented library for toolpath smoothing and based my master's thesis on it
* Developed and maintainted project of multiaxis roughing
* **Tools**: C++03, Boost, Computational geometry tools, Svn
<details><summary>Multiaxis Roughing Demonstration</summary>
<p>
 <br>
 This toolpath generation algorithm was implemented as a combination of approaches between 5ax and 3ax project areas.
 My aim was actual implementation of already scoped project and pushing it to production.
Here is the marketing demonstration of this tool.
